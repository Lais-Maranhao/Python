Hello, 
This is a repository to showcase the projects I developed during courses on the CodeAcademy platform.
The projects done here refer to the course:


* ## Career Path - Data Scientist: Machine Learning
  ### Modules:

    *Data Science Foundations I: 

      Get started with the foundations. By the end of this section, you'll be able to conduct an exploratory analysis of a dataset with both Python and SQL.


    *Data Science Foundations II:

      Build on your foundations with statistics, data visualization, and cleaning. By the end of this section, you'll be able to work independently with a dataset of your choosing.

    *Machine Learning I:

      Get started in machine learning with the most classic algorithms to solve, classification and regression problems while getting  familiar with feature engineering. You'll explore both supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms.
      

    *Machine Learning II

      Keep building your machine learning knowledge with ensemble methods, SVMs, Recommender Systems, and Naive Bayes algorithms.

    *Machine Learning III

        *Take your machine learning skills to the next level by learning about neural networks and get hands-on practice building your own. Put your data science knowledge to work with a portfolio project to get you job-ready.
